## Twinship

Dizygotic (DZ) twinning rates display a large between-population variation, with the highest incidence found in West and Central Africa. Given the multi-factorial etiology of DZ twin births, there is not likely one single explanation for the persistence of such an appreciable variation. However, DZ twinning is known to be genetically heritable, with consequences that are sometimes [very evident at the population level](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020328). The continued existence of twinning is a bit of an evolutionary puzzle in itself, given its significant biological costs, which would lead us to expect that natural selection would remove genotypes conducive to higher propensity to give birth to twins.
At the same time, twinning is also highly culturally salient in several societies in this "high-twinning" region of Sub-Saharan Africa, where the birth of twins may have both positive (*geminophilous*) and negative valence (*geminophobic*), depending on the group. Geminophilous groups assign a special status to twins, attributing them the ability to bestow wealth and good luck over their family and increasing the prestige of their parents. Geminophobic groups, on the other hand, used to shun and ostracize twins, sometimes to the point of allowing the infanticide of one of them, or both.

We (me and my supervisors) hypothesized that a dynamic of gene-culture co-evolution might have taken place
