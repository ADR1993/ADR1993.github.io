Here is a brief review of my current research interests.

## Fieldwork in Benin

## Twinship

Dizygotic (DZ) twinning rates display a large between-population variation, with the highest incidence found in West and Central Africa. Given the multi-factorial etiology of DZ twin births, there is not likely one single explanation for the persistence of such an appreciable variation. However, DZ twinning is known to be genetically heritable, with consequences that are sometimes [very evident at the population level](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21687665/). The continued existence of twinning is a bit of an evolutionary puzzle in itself, given its significant biological costs, which would let us expect that natural selection would remove genotypes conducive to higher propensity to give birth to twins.

Twinning is also highly culturally salient in several societies in this "high-twinning" region of Sub-Saharan Africa, where the birth of twins may have both positive (*geminophilous*) and negative valence (*geminophobic*), depending on the group. 

We (me and my supervisors) hypothesized that a dynamic of gene-culture co-evolution might have taken place
