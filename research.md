# Research interests

Here is a brief review of my current research interests.

## Fieldwork in Benin

During the course of my doctorate I set up a data collection project in two villages in Benin, West Africa, where full census data, social network information, and data on networked economic games were collected. I am currrently in the process of developing a database to store such information. 

## Twinship

Dizygotic (DZ) twinning rates display a large between-population variation, with the highest incidence found in West and Central Africa. Given the multi-factorial etiology of DZ twin births, there is not likely one single explanation for the persistence of such an appreciable variation. However, DZ twinning is known to be genetically heritable, with consequences that are sometimes [very evident at the population level](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020328). 

The continued existence of twinning is a bit of an evolutionary puzzle in itself. Given its significant biological costs, which would lead us to expect that natural selection would remove genotypes conducive to higher propensity to give birth to twins. According to the most popular hypothesis, twinning might be maintained in the population because of natural selection favours some levels of polyovulation to offset embryo/foetal mortality, of which twinning is a "harmful" side effect.

At the same time, twinning is also highly culturally salient in several societies in this "high-twinning" region of Sub-Saharan Africa, where the birth of twins may have both positive (*geminophilous*) and negative valence (*geminophobic*), depending on the group. Geminophilous groups assign a special status to twins, attributing them the ability to bestow wealth and good luck over their family and increasing the prestige of their parents. Geminophobic groups, on the other hand, used to shun and ostracize twins, sometimes to the point of allowing the infanticide of one of them, or both.

We (me and my supervisors) hypothesized that a dynamic of gene-culture co-evolution might explain the high incidence of twin births in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa. Cultural strategies such as geminophilia (a support system to twins masked as a set of supernatural beliefs and practices) and geminophobia (the possibility of disposing of one twin to allocate parental resources to the other) might have emerged to deal with the adaptive problem posed by twin births, and could have been able to "subsidize" higher frequencies of the alleles underlying polyovulation. We presented the (verbal) argument [here](https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/6254/), and are currently working on developing a formal model of the co-evolutionary dynamic.
