# Research interests

I am interested in a variety of topics such as the demographic transition, evolutionary perspectives on religion, and twinship.

## Fieldwork in Benin

## Demographic transition



## Twinship

Dizygotic (DZ) twinning rates display a large between-population variation, with the highest incidence found in West and Central Africa. Given the multi-factorial etiology of DZ twin births, there is not likely one single explanation for the persistence of such an appreciable variation. However, DZ twinning is known to be genetically heritable, with consequences that are sometimes [very evident at the population level]([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21687665/]).
