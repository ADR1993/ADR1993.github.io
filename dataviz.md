# Data visualization and maps

I sometimes create data visualizations and maps as a hobby. You can find some of my attempts at portraying data in an aesthetically-pleasing way here. All data visualizations are produced with R, and the scripts used to generate them can be found [here](https://github.com/ADR1993/heterogony-of-ends).
